    It's an automated tool designed to find programmer’s productivity, 
    which considers the parameters such as, usage of memory and machine cycles or frequently used constructs. 
    Which results is differentiating between programmer’s who can write codes giving required output, and codes making efficient usage of memory and CPU(machine cycles involved in computations). 
    We've used certain predefined patterns for programming structures(loops, conditional statements etc.) on which the tool is applied to know a programmer's productivity

    Our project basically deals with the controlling of the home appliances with the android app and the security one can provide to its residents. 
    The owner of the house can monitor the log history as to who locked and unlocked the door along with the timings. 
    The overall idea is to make ones job easier and to reduce energy wastage as of forgetting the turning off of appliances which in turn lead to energy loss.
