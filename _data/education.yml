    During my time at BVB I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as programming, teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.
    
    I spent a lot of my free time as resolving problems in *Hackerrank* and *HackerEarth* platform and helping my classmates in their projects.
